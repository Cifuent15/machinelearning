Hi, I'm Luis Cifuentes.
Here I have basic neural networks algorithms and randomforest models. some of the archive are using the same dataset but with a different approach.

The archive "airpollution" and "nnairpollution" is about an machine learning and Neural Network algorithms capable of predicting wether in some conditions of air it affect human health or not.
The archive "hearth_attack" and "hearth_attcknn" is about a machine learning and Neural Network algorithms capable of find a relationship between clinical results and incidents of hearth attack.
The archive "nnanemia" is Neural Network algorithms capable of find a relationship between variables like Hb (hemoglobin) and other variables to find wether a person has anemia or not.

what does that mean the output of the algorithms that use Random Forest Classifier?
It is giving you the number of trees and the deepth of the tree that give you the best outcome or best score to make predictions.
